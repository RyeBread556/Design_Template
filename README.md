# Design_Template Completed

This section provides answers to the required questions as part of this assignment.

#1 Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

For this assignment I hypothically worked for a company named CTS (Creative Technology Solutions) My client The Gaming Room was looking to develop a web based game named Draw It or Loose it with the softare requirments 
including the ability to have one or more teams active within a single session, having multiple players be assigned to those teams, unique names and identifiers for both game and team names and the ability to check
if one is already in use, and allow only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.

#2 What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Id say I did particularly well within the sections that required analysis, having to research and look around for the needed information using resources was a enjoyable experience 
you learn a good portion of some of these within the classwork but alot of the blanks were filled in with more self research, one of the requirements was to find the pros and cons of 
various operating systsems for the apps development, Linux is covered quite a bit but Mac, MobileOS, and Windows for eaxmple were not.

#3 What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Well actually developing code or writing it I should say has always been a struggle for me, the idea of writing something from scratch or filling in the blanks to a pre-written application can be intimidating
especially when you move from language to language rapidly as you go through courses. However, what i have always found useful which this document does is breaking down what you need to do and what you are coding needs 
into digestable steps, the rest of the confusion can typically be solved utilzing class resources or outside resources like youtube for example.

#4 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The section I would aim to improve would be the Evaluation part of the document, personally I feel like alot of the descriptions I gave for the various operating systems seemed redundant to one another, what I mean 
is for example when I needed to provide the development tools available for every platform many of them were the same as the other Java was used in 3 out of the 4 total options, I feel as though choosing other ones that
were not listed would have made the document both more professional and descriptive in a real life situation.

#5 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Well it was emphasized throughout the course that cross platform capability, security, and effeciency under load were the big takeaways for this application(sure its the same for most) to fufill these requirements 
implementation of a proper operating system for example that could check most or all of the boxes was a must, it needeed to have well known security features and have support for distributed systems and software for
cross platform communication and all while having a well known reputation for handeling loads under stress, research lend to Linux in this regard. Linux has a wide range of security features like SELinux which has built in encryption along
with compatabilty with software like Docker which would be needed for consistancy in communication cross platform. Lastly, to support how implimented linux has a great file system EXT4 which is particualy useful in high stress or multi user enviorments.

It is important to consider the needs of a user because it can also make or break the success and how useable the application becomes, not meeting needs could cause the application to have unpredicatable or erractic behavior 
and as a result would make it innaccessable to all users. following this methods improves two things at once meeting the expectations that users typically would want and thus improving the software as a byproduct.

#6 How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

With the development of this application the approach was to ensure that its design was focused upon the user needs through analysis of the requirements given by the client which were efficiency, security, cross compatability thus, it needed to designed modularly so it could be maintained and 
updated as needed without complication, needed to be scalable as changes and updates were made over time and had features like containerization that supported this need, lastly security was part of its makeup like encryption. For future approaches I think maintaining the mindset of meeting user needs is
paramount, you not only improve the application but make it applealing to the using audiance at hand, thus doing two things at once as a result, Also breaking it down into more digestable steps like meantioned before makes it easier to develop and change if anything different needs to be utilized based
upon client needs, in a nutshell Agile Development.
